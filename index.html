            Explore India´s first World Heritage City, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
            The city of Ahmedabad is endowed with a rich architectural heritage that is vital to the local identity and continuity of the place. Along with the foremost heritage Indo-Islamic monuments of the 15th to 17th centuries, there are potential heritage precincts in the form of the Pols, the traditional residential clusters of the medieval period, which makes Ahmedabad exceptional. Combining these all, the historic walled city of Ahmedabad has it all to be the first city in India to be inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage City list of 2017.

                    Built in 1451 as Hauz e Qutub, and recently converted as a recreation space for the city, this large lake is a good respite from the hectic streets. In fact, this is the second largest lake of Ahmedabad, offering a pleasing visual break from the buildings and roads.

                <article id="rkl" class="extra_read">
                    <p>The origin of Kankaria Lake goes back to Chalukyan times. According to the 14th century chronicler Merutunga, the Chalukya ruler Karna built a temple dedicated to the goddess Kochharba. He also established the Karnavati city close to Ahmedabad, where he commissioned the Karnamukteshwara and Jayantidevi temples. The king also built the Karnasagara tank at Karnavati next to Karneshvara Temple. They say Karnasagar tank is today’s Kankaria Lake. Though the construction was started by lake started by Sultan Muizz-ud-Din Muhammad Shah II, it was completed in 1451 in Ahmedabad’s architectural golden period by Sultan Qutb-ud-Din Ahmad Shah II. Researchers say that the name Hauj-e-Qutb (the tank of Qutb) after the Sultan Qutb-ud-Din was the original name of the lake.
                    Historians believe that the lake gets its name from the large quantities of limestone (kankar in Gujarati) that was dug out of it during excavation. Another story narrates that the Sultan Qutb-ud-Din asked Saint Shah Alam to select the site for a tank and a garden in his kingdom. The saint scattered some pebbles on the site, which was later excavated and the lake was built on the exact spot. A different story leans towards the saint Hazrat-i-Shah Alam’s saga, in which he cut his foot on a sharp pebble while passing through excavation. The lake was then called Kankaria or full of pebbles.</p>
